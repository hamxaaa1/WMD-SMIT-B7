        1) Century year exception: However, there's an exception for century years (years ending in 00).
           A century year is only a leap year if it's also divisible by 400. 
           Divisibility by 4:

        2) A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4. This means there's no remainder when you divide 
           the year by 4.

        3) Years divisible by both 100 and 400 ARE leap years. For example, 2000 is a leap year (2000 / 4 = 500). 

        4) Years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years.
           For example, 1900 is not a leap year (1900 / 4 = 475).
